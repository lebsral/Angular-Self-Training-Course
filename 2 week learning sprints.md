Setting up a computer as developement environment
--------------------------------------------------

1. Back up your mac.  Time machine is great, use it.
2. Update your mac to the most recent version of the OS.
3. Install xcode.  You get it from the app store.  Open it once after  you install it to accept the terms and license.
4. Install Node. https://nodejs.org/download/
This also gets you NPM  (Node Package Manager)  which we will need 
5.  Get some text editiors. 
http://www.sublimetext.com/
http://brackets.io/ (Be sure to get it with extract)

6. Find your terminal.  (it is in the applications utilites folder)  Try out the following commands cd cd.. ls ls -la  touch mkdir
http://guides.macrumors.com/Terminal

Get some accounts
7. Code repositories.
Make free accounts on both github.com and bitbucket.com
Due to their pricing stuctures github is better for open projects that you want the world to see.  and Bitbucket is better for small projects that you want to keep private.

8.  Get sourcetree


9. install these...
http://bower.io/
npm install -g bower

http://yeoman.io/
npm install -g yo

http://gulpjs.com/
npm install -g gulp

Get the angular batarang for chrome  (and chrome itself if you don't already have it)

We need to sign in with a free account.
Watch the videos in order.  Do the exercises.  Don't get stuck ('buy' the answers if needed).  But don't dont copy and paste the answers.  Acutally retype them.  We need to get our fingers used to typing Angular.
